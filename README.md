# Golden-Section-Method
 It is a code that I wrote by using matlab language by using golden section method.
 The Golden Section Search method is a method to find the extremum point of a function that 
contains only one maximum or minimum point on a closed interval. To use the golden section 
method, first, we have to choose 2 points in the closed interval. Letâ€™s name these points as x1 and x2
and the closed interval as [xlow,xup]. If f(x1) is greater than f(x2), we change the closed interval to
[x1,xup]. If f(x2) is greater than f(x1), then we change the closed interval to [xlow,x2]. We do the 
same calculations until we find the solution point.
